# Webhooks

Thepeer sends webhooks for certain events, at the time of this writing; we only send webhooks to receving businesses when a transaction is performed with them.

<Callout emoji={"‼️"}>
    You must set your webhook URL on your business dashboard in order to receive webhook notifications.
</Callout>

## Webhook verification

Valid webhook requests have a header with the key `X-Thepeer-Signature` which is a `HMAC SHA1` signature of the request body (hex encoded).
The request body is signed using your **secret key**.

### Steps

- Sign the entire request body with HMAC SHA1 using your secret key.
- Compare the result of this signing with the value of the `X-Thepeer-Signature` header.
- If they match, then the request is indeed from Thepeer

Here's an example in php:

import Bleed from 'nextra-theme-docs/bleed'

<Bleed>
<>
```php
<?php

$signature = hash_hmac('sha1', '{"message":"test signing}', 'your-secret-key');

if ($signature === $_SERVER['X-Thepeer-Signature']) {
    // return status 200
} else {
    // return status 406
}
```
</>
</Bleed>

<Callout emoji={"✅"}>
    You must return status `200` if a webhook verification is successful unless the Thepeer will retry a couple more times until it stops.
